# Bruin_Game_Studios_Team-Moba
A repository for the Moba currently under development by Bruin Game Studios, a game development club at UCLA

## Setup Instructions
1. Install Unreal Engine 4.10. To do this you'll need to install the Epic Games Launcher,
following the directions here: https://www.unrealengine.com/dashboard
2. Launch UE 4.10, and see if have the option to create a **C++** project (Do not actually create one). If you do not have a version of MS Visual Studio 2015,
there will be an error present, and a button to install MSVS 2015 Community Version. Click this and follow its instructions
3. Create an empty directory named wherever you'd like to develop. Clone this project into the directory
  - This will grab the files I thought necessary to be kept in source control, but there are more files that still need to be generated through project creation
4. Rename the cloned repository foler to **Moba** (the folder is name Bruin_Game_Studios_Team-Moba by default)
5. Create a new **Top Down C++ Project** through UE 4.10, and select the parent folder of the **Moba** folder you just renamed as the path. Name the Unreal project **Moba**
6. In git, revert any changes that show up. These are files that were overwritten when you created the project template, so we need to restore them to what they were when you cloned.
7. You should now be good to go!
