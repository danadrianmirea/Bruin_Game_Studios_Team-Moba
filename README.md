# Bruin_Game_Studios_Team-Moba
A repository for the Moba currently under development by Bruin Game Studios, a game development club at UCLA

## Setup Instructions
1. Install Unreal Engine 4.10. To do this you'll need to install the Epic Games Launcher,
following the directions here: https://www.unrealengine.com/dashboard
2. Launch UE 4.10, and attempt to create a **C++** project. If you do not have a version of MS Visual Studio 2015,
there will be an error present, and a button to install MSVS 2015 Community Version. Click this and follow its instructions
3. Create an empty directory named **Moba** wherever you'd like to develop. Clone this project into the directory
  - This will grab the files deemded necessary to be kept in source control, but there are more files that still need to be created through project creation
4. Create a new **Top Down C++ Project** through UE 4.10, and select the parent folder or your folder you clone as your path, and name the project **Moba**
5. You should now be good to go!
